# AR Virtual Keyboard

AR Virtual Keyboard is a project that utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) and computer vision techniques to create a virtual keyboard that can be projected onto any flat surface. It allows users to type on the projected keyboard using hand gestures captured by a webcam.

## Features

- Projection of virtual keyboard onto a flat surface using AR techniques.
- Hand gesture recognition for typing on the virtual keyboard.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: Web framework for serving the application.
- OpenCV: Computer vision library for hand gesture recognition.
- Python: Programming language used for backend development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/AR_Virtual-Keyboard.git](https://github.com/blackmamba-ops/AR_Virtual-Keyboard.git)
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd AR_Virtual-Keyboard
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the virtual keyboard.
4. Use hand gestures in front of the webcam to type on the virtual keyboard.
